Excited to share that I've recently completed a project where I built a Netflix clone using React.js and Firebase! ðŸš€ This project allowed me to dive deep into frontend development with React, including state management, component architecture, and responsive design.
Using Firebase for authentication and database management added another layer of functionality to the app, enabling seamless user interactions and data storage. I also focused on deploying the app to ensure it's accessible to users globally.
Curious to see it in action? Feel free to check out my LinkedIn profile for a demonstration!
